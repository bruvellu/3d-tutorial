# 🧊 Visualization of 3D data in Fiji

This tutorial shows different approaches to visualize 3D microscopy data in [Fiji](https://fiji.sc). It provides a quick introduction to some of the bundled tools such as [Orthogonal Views](https://imagej.net/imaging/z-functions#orthogonal-views), [Volume Viewer](https://imagej.net/imaging/z-functions#volume-viewer), [3D Viewer](https://imagej.net/plugins/3d-viewer/), and [BigDataViewer](https://imagej.net/plugins/bdv/), and a more in-depth explanation of the plugin [3Dscript](https://bene51.github.io/3Dscript/).
